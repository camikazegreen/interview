7.x-1.0-alpha1, 2015-07-10
--------------------------
- Preparing to tag 7.x-1.0-alpha1.
- Renaming README for consistency's sake.
- Changed package name to be consistent with other features.
- Removed project line to prevent complications.
- Keeping w/ conventions: changed version from 7.x-1.0-dev to 7.x-1.x-dev.
- Deleted some core modules I accidentally listed that are not needed.
