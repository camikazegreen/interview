- Fixed the container width in the 12 column bootstrap scss - site was only getting as wide as 960px.
- Added an option to have column menus in the footer by placing the class 'column-menu' on the block. Equal border height is being controlled by a min-height of 16em - couldn't find an elegant solution that didn't touch the sub-footer border. Also centered the logo and copyright on smaller screens.

- New side menu styles - other branch was having inexplicable merge conflicts.
- Merge branch '7.x-1.x' of https://bitbucket.org/macaulay/ua-zen into views-sass.
- Merged sub-footer into 7.x-1.x after approval in ua_drupal team repo.
- Merged in macaulay/ua-zen/sub-footer (pull request #14).
- Better styling for default view pagers - added new sass file for views-specific component styling.
- Altered styles in footer to target only ul.menu instead of all ul elements--still needs to be changed in catstrap.
- Made date piece in sub footer output via php (forgot to implement earlier).
- Re-structured logic in footer template to only include one container element if either the logo or content are active.
- Added logic to have main footer area print only if the logo turned on in the theme settings or there is content to display.
- Forced footer to render with template function theme_preprocess_page. Added styling to footer logo to not exceed 100px in height or 400px in width. Also removed old ua_footer regions from template.php.
- Seeing if removing 'render' from template forces region to print.
- Added background color to the HTML element so that the footer doesn't look cut off on shorter pages on large screens.
- Added border to bottom of footer instead of top of sub footer.
- Added top border and padding to visally set sub footer apart and changed the font size to be slightly smaller.
- Forced sub footer to be rendered in page template and added a copyright paragraph with an automatically updating year.
- Added sub footer region template file and added region to page templates. Had to break the #footer_site div out into the main page template in order to nest the sub footer into the main footer area. Still need to force the sub footer region to render even if no blocks are specified (for global footer copyright).
- Added sub footer region to info file... but should page bottom be removed and the UA Main Footer and UA Hidden Footer?.
- Added margin to logo for smaller screens.
- Added simple styling to make the footer logo float to the left of the content when on large screen.
- Added footer logo styling to make the logo float to the right of the content - sass isn't compiling in my local environment though... but changes have been made in the sass file.

- Merged in macaulay/ua-zen (pull request #12).

- Committed @mmunro-ltrr patch to fix the non object property problem. It works!.
- Attempted to get rid of error message - no dice. Not sure what logic I have to wrap the variable definitions in to supress the warning... don't know enough php.
- Made the footer logo path into an alias instead of an absolute path (more elegant way to do this?). Added logic in footer template  to display the site's main logo in case a secondary logo isn't uploaded. Unfortunately still experiencing a 'non-object' error when there's no footer image specified.
- Not able to be referenced for logo alt text - not really needed anyway, empty alt attribute will allow screen readers to skip without incident.
- Made path into an image element in the tpl.php. Styling for positioning still needed.
- Removed debugging output with file_create_url to get the file's correct path.
- Apparently, cron will delete any files uploaded in theme settings unless their status is set to permanent (by default the status is temporary) - not a minor task in themes to get a file to persist: http://ghosty.co.uk/2014/03/managed-file-upload-in-drupal-theme-settings - getting there... going to see if the file sticks.
- Footer region template can see the file ID of the uploaded image, but the file path isn't getting through... only showing root URL of website.
- Clarified source of code for footer logo variable in template.php.
- Attempt to make the footer logo's file available to tpl.php - so far only getting undefined error.
- Merge branch '7.x-1.x' of https://bitbucket.org/uabrandingdigitalassets/ua-zen into footer-logo.
- Added footer image upload field in the Theme Settings area - file not being called/placed by the template yet.

- Changed the search placeholder text back to HTML5 attribute.
- Accidentally cloned in wrong directory...

- Altered the search function to be specifically for search form with theme_form_search_block_form_alter and changed to javascript because the HTML5 version doesn't get rid of the placeholder text until the user starts typing.
- Added placeholder text for idle search box field.
- Made UA Header into it's own region template file to keep the page.tpl tidy and be able to also put the UA footers (a lot of code) into their own templates eventually - idea/code from Chris Green.
- Accidentally left 'ua_omega' in the html preprocess function from previous commit.
