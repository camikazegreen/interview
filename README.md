## Views ##

There are two views: a block with a list of 6 events and a full calendar view (responsive and not table-based).

**Note about full calendar view:** By default, the full calendar view is paginating by month. If you do not have *at least* the 7.x-2.9-alpha version of the date module, the calendar will show the wrong date format at the top of the page (see https://www.drupal.org/node/2294973 for full details).

### Structure ###

Included fields:

- Event title (block and page)
- Event date (block and page - several different formats used)
- Event summary (page only)

### Styling ###

#### Styling classes are as follows: ####

- **Full Calendar class:** *ua-event-calendar*
- **Block class:** *ua-event-block-list*
- **Row class:** *ua-event-row*
