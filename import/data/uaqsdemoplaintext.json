Each segment of the circle bears a label in Latin, so Pride appears as <em>Superbia</em>, with the other labels being <em>Ira</em>, <em>Luxuria</em>, <em>Accidia</em>, <em>Gula</em>, <em>Avaricia</em> and <em>Invidia</em>. The Latin names sound more distinguished than their English translations (particularly in the case of <em>Luxuria</em>), so the initial name change will be to <em>Superbia Arizonensis</em> (still referring to Pride), and the name will cycle through the other six labels, changing at the start of a new semester. The alternation reflects the band's new commitment to explore different musical possibilities, and the use of Latin reflects the depth of tradition which will lie behind it."
